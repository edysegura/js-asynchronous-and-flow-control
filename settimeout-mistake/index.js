// Common mistake is to think the timer is an exact predictor of when the event handler will fire, but it isnâ€™t necessarily.
// The event handler still has to wait its turn in the queue. By measuring time, we can see this in action.
function timer() {
  let start = Date.now()
  setTimeout(() => {
    let end = Date.now()
    console.log('Duration: ' + (end - start))
